# Github-profile-readme
A super awsome tip how to make a readme for your github profile.
How do I create a profile README?
The profile README is created by creating a new repository thatâ€™s the same name as your username. For example, my GitHub username is m0nica so I created a new repository with the name m0nica. Note: at the time of this writing, in order to access the profile README feature, the letter-casing must match your GitHub username.

If you already have a project in a repo-named username/username and are interested in setting up a profile-level README, then I recommend either re-naming that repository or re-purposing the existing project's README based on what makes the most sense in your particular situation.

Create a new repository with the same name (including casing) as your GitHub username: https://github.com/new

Create a README.md file inside the new repo with content (text, GIFs, images, emojis, etc.)

Commit your fancy new README!

If you're on GitHub's web interface you can choose to commit directly to the repo's main branch (i.e., master or main) which will make it immediately visible on your profile)
Push changes to GitHub (if you made changes locally i.e., on your computer and not github.com)
